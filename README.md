# Final Year project
Here you can find the code for my final year project, I hope you can check it out.

I wrote the program in PyCharm, so if you don't already have an IDE I do recommend this one.

The only requirements to run the program are that you have Python installed on your device
and that you have the following packages installed pandas, numpy, cvxpy and csv.

In this repo I also have a test csv file that you can add to / play around with for the
sake of testing.

When reading your csv file into the program, make sure it is located in the same directory
as the program.
